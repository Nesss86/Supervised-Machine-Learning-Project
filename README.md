# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to use supervised learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements. The following stages were performed on the data set provided:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Training a machine learning model


## Process
### EDA

### Preprocessing
